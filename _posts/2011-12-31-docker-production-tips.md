biography:
    Jerome is a senior engineer at Docker, where he rotates between Ops, Support and Evangelist duties. In another life he built and operated Xen clouds when EC2 was just the name of a plane, developed a GIS to deploy fiber interconnects through the French subway, managed commando deployments of large-scale video streaming systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as conference centers, and various other feats of technical wizardry. When annoyed, he threatens to replace things with a very small shell script. His left hand cares for the dotCloud PAAS servers, while his right hand builds cool hacks around Docker.
