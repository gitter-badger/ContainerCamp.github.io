The advent of Docker has opened the door to new ways of deploying and hosting services, and the arrival of CoreOS and fleet gives us a nice abstraction to running containerised services on a cluster. But we need a layer on top of this to manage our services, handle seamless deploys with a load-balancer and manage multiple clusters and environments. This is the Docker PaaS. I'll be talking about my experiences in building a Docker PaaS at YLD.io and introducing it as a suite a tools available to developers.
