biography:
    <h1>Marc Cohen</h1>

    I lead a team in London focused on providing high quality sample apps, libraries, tools, and educational resources to help developers get the most out of Google's developer products. My team's current areas of concentration are Android libraries, Web components, and Web Developer tools.

    <h1>Alex Vaghin</h1>

    About 12 years ago I started playing with old hardware, creating little distributed systems and connecting them together. Today you can call me a huge fan of cloud platforms and APIs. I like Go programming language very much. Python and Ruby would be other preferred languages. Love playing with Docker, Polymer and HTML5 APIs (File, Storage, WebRTC, etc).

    I currently work as a Developer Programs Engineer at Google based in London, UK.

Polymer + Docker - Managing Containers in the Cloud using Open Web Components

Web components solve a number of shortcomings in web development by bringing a world of improved reusability, encapsulation and extensibility to how developers build apps today. Polymer is a library that uses web components, and adds two-way data binding, declarative event handlers, property observation, gesture support, and other features to help you build powerful, reusable elements. 

The power of Polymer, the modularity of Docker, and the scalability of the cloud combine to offer a new approach to building web applications. This talk will feature an overview of Polymer, along with code snippets and demos showing how this technology can be used to orchestrate Docker container deployment in the Google Cloud Platform.
