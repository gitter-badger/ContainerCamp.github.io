biography:
    I’m Chris Swan – a 40something bloke living in the UK. When I’m not working or blogging I like to spend my time shooting at stuff, riding/driving fast vehicles and throwing myself down steep inclines covered in snow. I also enjoy good food (and cooking it) and good wine/port/bourbon (in fact pretty much most things that taste nice with alcohol in them). I’m a keen fan of (home) cinema, prog rock and SciFi.

A look at how stock Docker does networking, and how containers can be connected together. Introduction to libchan and pipework projects, and a look at container internetworking using Open vSwitch and kernel VXLAN. Docker can also be used as a place to run layer 4-7 network application services like SSL termination, proxying, load balancing, content caching and intrusion detection.
