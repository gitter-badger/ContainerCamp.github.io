Docker and AWS make a great couple. Docker can provide additional encapsulation and control while EC2 provides the scalable infrastructure. This session will show you how you can run Docker on EC2 using OpsWorks and easily combine the two. We will leverage the power of Chef to control Docker and use Docker for application and service deployment.
