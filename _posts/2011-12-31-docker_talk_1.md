biography: |+
    Jerome is a senior engineer at Docker, where he rotates between Ops,
    Support and Evangelist duties. In another life he built and operated
    Xen clouds when EC2 was just the name of a plane, developed a GIS to
    deploy fiber interconnects through the French subway, managed 
    commando deployments of large-scale video streaming systems in
    bandwidth-constrained environments such as conference centers, and
    various other feats of technical wizardry. When annoyed, he
    threatens to replace things with a very small shell script. His left
    hand cares for the dotCloud PAAS servers, while his right hand builds
    cool hacks around Docker.
