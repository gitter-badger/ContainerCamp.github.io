It seems like an eternity since Docker 1.0 came out but it's only been
three months! This talk will walk through what's changed since then and
what's on the roadmap for the Docker ecosystem in the next few months.
We'll cover Docker, Docker Hub, as well as orchestration and other areas
of interest.
