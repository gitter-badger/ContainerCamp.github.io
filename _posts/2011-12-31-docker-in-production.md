biography:
    Jerome is a senior engineer at Docker, where he rotates between Ops, Support and Evangelist duties. In another life he built and operated Xen clouds when EC2 was just the name of a plane, developed a GIS to deploy fiber interconnects through the French subway, managed commando deployments of large-scale video streaming systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as conference centers, and various other feats of technical wizardry. When annoyed, he threatens to replace things with a very small shell script. His left hand cares for the dotCloud PAAS servers, while his right hand builds cool hacks around Docker.

Docker 1.0 is here, and it's "ready for production." But are we?

After installing Docker on your machine and writing your first Dockerfile,
you may be faced with an avalanche of questions: Can we integrate with our
existing configuration management systems, or do we need to start from
scratch? How do we deal with logging, backups, remote access? What are the
best practices for monitoring application health? How do we gather
performance metrics, and then how do we fine-tune our containers'
performance? What's the best way to deploy and manage clusters of
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of Docker hosts?</p>

We will answer all those questions (and a few more), in a barrage of
tips, tricks, and insights about how to use Docker in production
for applications big and small.
