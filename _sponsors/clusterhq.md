At ClusterHQ, we describe ourselves as The Data People for Docker. We believe that support for portable and resilient data volumes is a major missing piece of the puzzle for Docker. Without support for data migration, cloning and failover, Docker is unable to easily capture entire applications (including databases, queues, and key-value stores) in production in a way that ops can manage. Lack of support for data-backed services is a major criticism leveled against PaaS recently, and a criticism that we think has merit. Why should the heart of most applications live outside the platform?

We are solving these data portability issues through our open source project,Flocker. Flocker is a lightweight volume and container manager that lets developers deploy their entire app, including its databases, to multiple hosts, and then migrate them later as operations demands. Need to upgrade the RAM on the machine running your database?  Flocker can migrate your data volume to a larger node and re-route all network connections so you donâ€™t have to change your code or mess with slow DNS updates.
